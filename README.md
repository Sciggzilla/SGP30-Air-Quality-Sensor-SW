# SGP30-Air-Quality-Sensor-SW
This is a Star Wars themed air quality sensor and interactive wall mounted box.

**This is one of the first projects I've done on my own. I'm sure there are snippets of code that are inefficient.**

This project was created using the Arduino IDE, and was designed for use with the Arduino Nano.

"Why don't you have the schematic to the PCB," you might ask? Well, because I used this as a way to explore KiCAD, and I definitely somehow stumbled my way into creating the PCB without the schematic. Would not recommend, as it took way longer. But hey, I learned a lot, and at least it works. I'll upload a full schematic at a later point.

Components:

- 1x Arduino Nano (clone not recommended, as the Schottky diode by the USB may burn out with this setup)
- 1x DFPlayer Mini MP3 Player
- 1x Adafruit SGP30 Air Quality Sensor Breakout - VOC and eCO2
- 1x 12mm slide switch
- 1x potentiometer 10K
- 14x WS2812b Neopixel LEDs
- 2x red LEDs
- 2x 1K resistors
- 2x 10K resistors
- 4x 220 Ohm resistors
- 1x 330 Ohm resistor
- 1x speaker module
- 2x momentary pushbuttons 
- 3x 680uf 16V capacitors

3D files were made in TinkerCAD
